1. **Define Discriminated Union for Events**  
   - Create each event type as an interface with a unique literal `kind` property and a type-specific payload.
   - Combine all events into a `FinancialEvent` union type.
   - Provide a string union for valid event kinds and a mapping from kind to event type.

2. **Type Safe Plugin Interface**  
   - Define a generic `Plugin` type parameterized by supported event kinds.
   - Each plugin's `handlers` object maps event kind to a function accepting the strictly-typed corresponding event.
   - Use a helper `createPlugin` to assist authors in creating plugins with strong typing.

3. **Exhaustive Event Processing Pipeline**  
   - Implement a `processEventPipeline` function, enforcing that each plugin only processes events it declares support for, with strict event kind mapping.
   - Build an `exhaustiveEventHandler` utility that can be used to ensure all event kinds are handled in a switch statement, erroring at compile time if any are missed.
   
4. **Example Plugins with Strict Typing**  
   - Write example plugins (e.g. censor, chunker, logger) using `createPlugin`. Types ensure handlers can only manipulate their events.
   - Demonstrate the pipeline by processing a batch of events, showcasing type safety; e.g., accessing withdraw payload in a deposit handler would be a type error.

5. **Verify Type Safety Extensibility**
   - Adding new event kinds or plugins will require explicit handler definitions, and missing or mismatched handlers will trigger compile errors.
   - This ensures the dynamic event processing logic remains robust and future-proof.
